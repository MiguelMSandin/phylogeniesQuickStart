# Before starting, why phylogenetic inference?  
(If you are only interested on the 'how', you can directly go to the [summary](/book/10_summary.md) section).
  
Phylogenetic inference allows the exploration of **evolutionary relationships** among taxa beyond a pure pair-wise comparison of their differences.  
Evolutionary relationships are normally inferred from observed intrinsic properties of a group of organisms such as DNA sequences, protein sequences or morphological traits.  
The first molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed by Carl Woese and George Fox ([Woese and Fox, 1977](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.74.11.5088)). They defined the primary domains of life through 16S rRNA characterization. They provided a simple matrix of pairwise comparisons among DNA sequences, yet opened the doors for a much more complex field of molecular evolution.  
Nowadays, when reconstructing evolutionary patterns, we assume common ancestry and a dichotomic diversification of the studied organisms. And the best (or most accepted) way to represent such patterns is the so called **phylogenetic tree**.
