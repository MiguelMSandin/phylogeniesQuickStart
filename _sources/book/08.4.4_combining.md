# Combining different approaches.

When the phylogenetic inference is the core of your study, it is highly recommended to **replicate the phylogenetic tree with different approaches**. This is most commonly achieved by combining the support from different trees obtained by independent runs of maximum likelihood **and** Bayesian approaches.
Although not always it is possible to apply different approaches to the same dataset, for example for very large datasets a bayesian inference might fail to converge; or when estimating molecular ages a bayesian approach is much better suited since it allows uncertainty in the priors.
Other options could be to:
- (i) use different softwares (RAxML-ng vs. IQ-TREE),
- (ii) apply different models of evolution (GTR vs. CAT),
- (iii) or even to replicate the alignment with different softwares, options or reversing the sequences before aligning.
