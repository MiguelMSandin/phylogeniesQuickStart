**Phylogenetic tree thinking**: Interpreting phylogenetic trees seems *a priori* a simple task, since it is indeed a simple representation of a dichotomic diversification. Yet as we have seen throughout this crash course, a phylogenetic tree might lead to misinterpretation when not interpreted from an integrative methodological and biological perspective ([Meisel 2010](https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s12052-010-0254-9)). In this context, a single tree provides one version of a very complex process that requires a critical thinking and interpretation from many different points of view ([Doolitle and Bapteste, 2007](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0610699104)).  
  
Regarding the methodological aspect of phylogenetic reconstruction, models and parameters you can directly check in the (most of the times) very well documented hands-on tutorials of the open source softwares I introduced here. Besides, I highly encourage you to extend your possibilities and go fancy in phylogenetic inference by looking and exploring different options through the help command (i.e.; `iqtree -h`, `raxml-ng -h`), or through their online manuals and hands-on tutorials:
