# A hands-on introduction on molecular phylogenetic studies  
  
Here you will find a brief introduction on how to get started with phylogenetic analyses. All examples are given for nucleotide sequences, yet once you have gone through every step, you will feel more comfortable to try different models and datasets.  
  
Bear in mind that this is a quick practical guide for phylogenetic inference of nucleotide sequences. I tried to explain only important or crucial concepts for a non-expert audience, so these lines are far from exhaustive and very simplified.
